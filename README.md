## Do not modify the code 

## Before running the code:
```
Need to add the map Cactus Valley:
    Create a folder named "Maps" in the folder where "StarCraft.exe" is
    located.
    Download file "CactusValleyLE.SC2Map" from the rep. and place it in 
    the folder created.
```
## Bot strategy
```
This is one of the two bots we are going to implement

One base Dark Templars:
Out of one base and two vespene gases build 5-6 Gateways (to warp dark templars), 
Robotics Facility (for a Warp Prism) and all neccesary tech (Twilight Council, 
Dark Shrine and Cybernetics Core). Also build a Forge and some Photton Cannons 
to defend early attacks.
Send the Warp prism to our opponent's main base, warp Dark Templars and send them 
to attack. 

This is really effective if our opponent do not have some form of detection.
```

## Work so far:
```
scout
vespene gas extraction
all tech and buildings are set to be build in any starting location
```

## TO-DOs:
```
optimize build order 
expand (?)
research Warp Gate
buld and send a Warp Prism to our opponent's base
warp in Dark Templars and attack
```
