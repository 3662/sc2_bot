## Before running the code:
```
Need to add the map Cactus Valley:
    Create a folder named "Maps" in the folder where "StarCraft.exe" is
    located.
    Download file "CactusValleyLE.SC2Map" from the rep. and place it in 
    the folder created.
```

## Work so far:
```
Currently sending the 3 probe scouts to potential startin positions of our 
opponent.

Building pylons and a forge in  random locations (in our main base).

Nexus creating up to 21 workers and idle workers (that are not scouts) return
back to mining 
```

## TO-DOs:
```
Currently building the first pylon and forge in a random location. Build them
blocking the entrance of our main.

Scout are doing nothing. Identify where our opponent is and build the first
pylon in our opponent's base.
```
